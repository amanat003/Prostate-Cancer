Bioinformatics analysis has been playing a vital role in identifying potential genomic biomarkers more accurately from an enormous number of candidates by reducing time and cost compared to wet-lab-based experimental procedures for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapies. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most malignant diseases seen in men worldwide. This study aimed at identifying potential key genes (KGs), and candidate drugs for PCa diagnosis and targeting therapies. Three publicly available microarray datasets of PCa were analyzed for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by Bioconductor R package called limma. We identified 458 common DEGs (cDEGs) and these genes were mapped to the STRING database to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We extracted the top 15 hub genes (TOP2A, RRM2, NCAPG, BUB1B, CENPU, CENPF, AURKA, TPX2, MKI67, BIRC5, CDCA5, NUSAP1, EZH2, ECT2, and TK1) by the PPI network analysis. The survival analysis of the hub genes disclosed that the lower expressions of the five hub genes BIRC5, CDCA5, CENPF, NUSAP1, and TK1 were associated with better survival of PCa patients. These five genes might be the candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Then, we considered 5 key proteins (genomic biomarkers) (BIRC5, CDCA5, CENPF, NUSAP1, and TK1) as the drug target proteins (receptors), performed their docking analysis with the 211 meta-drug agents, and found Adapalene, Ergotamine, Irinotecan Hydrochloride, Drospirenone, Abiraterone Acetate, Zafirlukast, Ibrutinib, Abiraterone, Imatinib, and Telmisartan as the top-ranked 10 candidate drugs with respect to our proposed target proteins for the treatment against PCa patients. Therefore, the proposed drugs might play a vital role in the treatment of PCa patients.
